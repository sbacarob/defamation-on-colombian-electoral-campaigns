    "\n",
    "If you prefer to use Twitter's API to obtain the data you'll find steps to do so further down. However, Twitter's API limitations don't allow for extracting much data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, I've created a script called `extractor.py` that works with Selenium and BeautifulSouop to extract the data and it will work without any API keys. You will, however, need to install the Selenium package for Python and download the driver you wish to use. My script runs using Firefox with [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you can generate a better dataset using this than the free version of Twitter's API. There's a tradeoff regarding the amount of time it takes to retrieve the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Retrieving the data using the script\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Install the Selenium package for Python\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using Conda, it'll be enough to run `conda install selenium`, otherwise, you can install it with pip using `pip install selenium`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Download a driver for a browser\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, my version of the script works with Firefox using the geckodriver, which you can download from [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases), depending on the version of the browser you have installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also run the browser in headless mode, meaning that you won't see the driver performing tasks. It will do it invisibly. You can read about how to do that in Selenium docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Add the driver to your `PATH`\n",
    "\n",
    "On Linux based systems, you can achieve this by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ export PATH=\"/path/to/driver/dir:$PATH\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** this will only keep the path in your `PATH` for the current terminal session. You can look for ways to add it in a definitive way if you so wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Import the script and use its functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Update:** After running this method for a couple of times Twitter seems to have blocked my IP for the specific queries I was running. Therefore, I've added a little extra step, which is using a proxy server. This forced me to switch to Firefox, because Chrome wasn't loading the websites using the proxy server. So, you should add a host for a proxy server before using this. You can easily find proxy servers by just running a Google search for 'Fresh proxies' or something like that."
